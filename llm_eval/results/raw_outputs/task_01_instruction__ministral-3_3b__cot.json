  "response": "**Product Review:**\n\nThe **EcoTower Laptop Stand** ($35) offers an ergonomic upgrade for long work sessions, elevating your screen to reduce neck strain. A stand like this is a great investment for those who spend hours typing, though it\u2019s best suited for smaller laptops due to its limited height adjustment.\n\nWhile the sleek design adds a modern touch to your workspace, the plastic build feels slightly flimsy compared to metal alternatives. Overall, it\u2019s a solid choice for comfort and affordability, earning **[4/5 stars]**.",
