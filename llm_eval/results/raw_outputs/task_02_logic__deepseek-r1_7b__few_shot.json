  "prompt": "Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Provide: (1) your answer (Valid/Invalid), (2) brief explanation.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nPremise 1: All mammals are warm-blooded.\nPremise 2: Whales are mammals.\nConclusion: Whales are warm-blooded.\n\nResponse:\nValid. This is a valid deductive argument following modus ponens. If all mammals are warm-blooded (P1) and whales are mammals (P2), then whales must be warm-blooded.\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nPremise 1: Some birds can fly.\nPremise 2: Penguins are birds.\nConclusion: Penguins can fly.\n\nResponse:\nInvalid. The first premise states 'some birds' can fly, not 'all birds'. This is a formal fallacy - we cannot conclude that penguins specifically have the ability to fly from these premises.\n\n---\n\nNow solve this:\n\nPremise 1: No reptiles are warm-blooded.\nPremise 2: All snakes are reptiles.\nConclusion: No snakes are warm-blooded.",
  "response": "The argument follows logically from the premises.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Premise 1:** No reptiles are warm-blooded.  \n   - This means all reptiles lack the ability to be warm-blooded.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** All snakes are reptiles.  \n   - Snakes are a subset of reptiles, so they inherit the characteristic stated in Premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** No snakes are warm-blooded.  \n   - Since all snakes are reptiles and no reptile is warm-blooded, it logically follows that snakes cannot be warm-blooded.\n\n**Response:**\n\nValid. The conclusion correctly follows from the premises using a straightforward logical structure.",
