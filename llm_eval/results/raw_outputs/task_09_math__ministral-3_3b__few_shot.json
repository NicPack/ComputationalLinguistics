  "prompt": "Solve the mathematical problem. Show your work step-by-step and explain your reasoning.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nProblem: A train travels from City A to City B at 60 km/h and returns at 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire round trip?\n\nResponse:\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Understand that average speed = total distance / total time\n(We CANNOT just average 60 and 40 to get 50 km/h)\n\nStep 2: Let d = distance from A to B\nTotal distance = 2d (round trip)\n\nStep 3: Calculate time for each leg\nTime A\u2192B: t\u2081 = d/60\nTime B\u2192A: t\u2082 = d/40\nTotal time: t = d/60 + d/40\n\nStep 4: Find common denominator\nt = (2d/120) + (3d/120) = 5d/120 = d/24\n\nStep 5: Calculate average speed\nAverage speed = 2d / (d/24) = 2d \u00d7 (24/d) = 48 km/h\n\nAnswer: 48 km/h\n\nNote: This is less than the arithmetic mean (50) because the train spends more time traveling at the slower speed.\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nProblem: If 3x + 7 = 22, what is the value of 6x + 10?\n\nResponse:\nStep 1: Solve for x\n3x + 7 = 22\n3x = 22 - 7\n3x = 15\nx = 5\n\nStep 2: Substitute x = 5 into 6x + 10\n6(5) + 10\n= 30 + 10\n= 40\n\nAnswer: 40\n\nAlternative approach: Notice that 6x + 10 = 2(3x + 7) - 4\nSo: 2(22) - 4 = 44 - 4 = 40\n\n---\n\nNow solve this:\n\nProblem: A store is having a 25% off sale. After the discount, a jacket costs $60. What was the original price?",
  "response": "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n**Problem:** A store is having a 25% off sale. After the discount, a jacket costs $60. What was the original price?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the discount**\nA 25% discount means the jacket is sold for 75% of its original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation**\nLet \\( P \\) be the original price of the jacket.\nAfter a 25% discount, the sale price is:\n\\[ 0.75 \\times P = 60 \\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( P \\)**\nTo find the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:\n\\[ P = \\frac{60}{0.75} \\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the original price**\n\\[ P = \\frac{60}{0.75} = 80 \\]\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** The original price of the jacket was **$80**.",
