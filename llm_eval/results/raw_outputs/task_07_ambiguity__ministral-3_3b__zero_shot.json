  "prompt": "Identify and explain the ambiguity in the given sentence. Provide at least two different interpretations.\n\nSentence: 'The professor said on Monday he would give the lecture.'",
  "response": "Here are two distinct interpretations of the ambiguous sentence:\n\n### **1. Interpretation: The professor committed to giving the lecture on Monday**\n   - **Grammar & Context:**\n     The sentence suggests that the professor **already made a definite plan** to give the lecture on Monday.\n     The phrase *\"he would give\"* here is used in a **conditional or future commitment** sense, implying a promise made before the event.\n   - **Example:**\n     *\"The professor said on Monday he would give the lecture.\"* \u2192 The professor **announced** the lecture date in advance (e.g., during a meeting or email).\n   - **Possible Scenario:**\n     The professor might have told students or colleagues that the lecture would be on Monday, and this was confirmed before the week started.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Interpretation: The professor is uncertain about giving the lecture on Monday**\n   - **Grammar & Context:**\n     Here, *\"he would give\"* is used in a **hypothetical or conditional** way, meaning the professor is **not sure** whether the lecture will happen on Monday.\n     The sentence could imply that the professor **might** give the lecture, but it is not guaranteed.\n   - **Example:**\n     *\"The professor said on Monday he would give the lecture.\"* \u2192 The professor **indicated a possibility** (e.g., in response to a student asking about the schedule).\n   - **Possible Scenario:**\n     The professor might have said this in a casual conversation, leaving the possibility open that the lecture could be postponed or canceled.\n\n---\n### **Key Ambiguity:**\nThe ambiguity arises because *\"he would give\"* can be interpreted in two ways:\n1. **A definite commitment** (the professor has already decided to give the lecture on Monday).\n2. **A conditional or uncertain statement** (the professor is not sure if the lecture will happen on Monday).\n\nThis ambiguity depends on the **context** (e.g., whether the professor was speaking in advance or in response to a question).",
