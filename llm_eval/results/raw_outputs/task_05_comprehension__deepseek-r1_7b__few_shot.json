  "prompt": "Read the passage and answer the question. Your answer should demonstrate understanding of implicit information, not just surface-level facts.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nPassage: The laboratory fell silent as Dr. Reeves examined the petri dish. Three years of work, countless sleepless nights, and innumerable failed experiments had led to this moment. She'd promised her daughter she'd make it to the recital tonight, but the bacterial colonies showed unexpected growth patterns that couldn't wait until morning. Her phone buzzed with a text: 'Mom, are you coming?' She turned the phone face-down.\n\nQuestion: What can we infer about Dr. Reeves' priorities in this moment?\n\nResponse:\nDr. Reeves is prioritizing her research over her family commitment. Despite promising to attend her daughter's recital, she's choosing to stay in the lab due to the unexpected experimental results. The detail of turning her phone face-down suggests she's avoiding the guilt of disappointing her daughter and fully committing to her work, even though this creates a personal cost. The passage implies a conflict between her professional dedication and parental responsibilities.\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nPassage: The village market hadn't changed in fifty years. Same wooden stalls, same families selling produce their grandparents once sold. But Maria noticed something different today\u2014each vendor was staring at their phone between customers. Old Giuseppe, who'd never trusted 'modern nonsense,' was scrolling through something intently. When she asked what had changed, he simply showed her his screen: a weather app predicting the first frost in three days.\n\nQuestion: What does this passage suggest about tradition and change?\n\nResponse:\nThe passage illustrates that tradition and technology aren't necessarily opposed\u2014people will adopt new tools when they serve essential purposes. The vendors maintain their traditional market roles while embracing smartphones for practical reasons (weather prediction matters for farmers). Giuseppe's adoption is particularly significant: even those most resistant to change will adapt when technology addresses real needs. The passage suggests that meaningful traditions can coexist with technological progress when the technology supports rather than replaces core values.\n\n---\n\nNow solve this:\n\nPassage: The museum's newest exhibit was empty at 3 PM on a Tuesday. Marcus, the security guard, wasn't surprised. He'd watched attendance drop every year for the past decade. Kids took selfies in the sculpture garden and left. Adults speed-walked through, checking items off bucket lists. But today, one woman sat alone before the Monet for nearly an hour, no phone in sight, just watching light play across painted water lilies. Marcus found himself standing beside her, seeing the painting differently.\n\nQuestion: What does this passage suggest about how people engage with art?",
  "response": "The passage suggests that art can provide a space for deep, concentrated engagement and reflection. Typically, museums see high attendance focused on taking selfies or moving quickly through exhibits. However, this particular instance highlights an individual who was deeply immersed in the Monet painting without distractions like a phone, leading to a more meaningful interaction. Marcus's observation indicates that even in an empty space, someone's presence can alter one's experience of art, emphasizing the importance of concentration and presence when engaging with art. Thus, the passage implies that art can be a place for introspection or deep engagement when people are fully present without distractions.",
