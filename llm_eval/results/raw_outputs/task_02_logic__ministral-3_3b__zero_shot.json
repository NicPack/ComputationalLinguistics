  "response": "(1) **Valid**\n(2) **Explanation:**\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises through **modus ponens** (a form of syllogistic reasoning):\n\n- **Premise 1** states a universal negative: *\"No reptiles are warm-blooded\"* (i.e., *All reptiles are non-warm-blooded*).\n- **Premise 2** states a universal inclusion: *\"All snakes are reptiles\"* (i.e., *Snakes \u2286 reptiles*).\n- By transitivity, since *all snakes are reptiles* and *no reptiles are warm-blooded*, it must be true that *no snakes are warm-blooded*.\n\nThis is a valid syllogism in classical logic.",
