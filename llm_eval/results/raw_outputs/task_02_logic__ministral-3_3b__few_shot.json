  "prompt": "Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Provide: (1) your answer (Valid/Invalid), (2) brief explanation.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\nPremise 1: All mammals are warm-blooded.\nPremise 2: Whales are mammals.\nConclusion: Whales are warm-blooded.\n\nResponse:\nValid. This is a valid deductive argument following modus ponens. If all mammals are warm-blooded (P1) and whales are mammals (P2), then whales must be warm-blooded.\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nPremise 1: Some birds can fly.\nPremise 2: Penguins are birds.\nConclusion: Penguins can fly.\n\nResponse:\nInvalid. The first premise states 'some birds' can fly, not 'all birds'. This is a formal fallacy - we cannot conclude that penguins specifically have the ability to fly from these premises.\n\n---\n\nNow solve this:\n\nPremise 1: No reptiles are warm-blooded.\nPremise 2: All snakes are reptiles.\nConclusion: No snakes are warm-blooded.",
  "response": "**Response:**\n\n**Valid.** This is a valid deductive argument following the **modus tollens** form.\n\n- Premise 1 states that *no reptiles are warm-blooded* (\u00ac(Reptile \u2192 Warm-blooded)).\n- Premise 2 states that *all snakes are reptiles* (Snake \u2192 Reptile).\n- The conclusion logically follows: *No snakes are warm-blooded* (\u00ac(Snake \u2192 Warm-blooded)).\n\nThe argument is sound because the premises directly enforce the conclusion through logical negation.",
