  "response": "Here\u2019s the ambiguity in the sentence **\"The professor said on Monday he would give the lecture,\"** broken down with two distinct interpretations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Interpretation: The professor\u2019s statement was made on Monday, and the lecture is scheduled for a future date.**\n- **Context**: The professor made the promise *on Monday* (e.g., during a meeting, email, or conversation).\n- **Implication**: The lecture is planned for a day *after* Monday (e.g., Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.), but the exact date/time is unspecified.\n- **Grammar**: The phrase *\"on Monday\"* modifies *\"said\"* (the action of communication), not the lecture itself.\n- **Example**:\n  > *\"During the faculty meeting on Monday, the professor announced that he would give the lecture next week.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Interpretation: The professor gave the lecture on Monday, and the statement was made about that event.**\n- **Context**: The professor *actually gave the lecture on Monday*, and the phrase *\"he would give the lecture\"* refers to that past event.\n- **Grammar**: Here, *\"on Monday\"* modifies *\"give\"* (the verb of the lecture), implying the lecture occurred on that day.\n- **Example**:\n  > *\"The professor said on Monday that he would give the lecture (which he did on Monday).\"*\n- **Ambiguity**: The listener might infer the lecture was *scheduled for Monday* (Interpretation 1) or *already happened* (Interpretation 2).\n\n---\n\n### **Why is this ambiguous?**\n- The preposition *\"on\"* can attach to either:\n  1. The *time of the statement* (e.g., *\"The professor said on Monday...\"*), or\n  2. The *time of the lecture* (e.g., *\"The professor said he would give the lecture on Monday\"*).\n- Without additional context (e.g., *\"The professor said on Monday that he would give the lecture next Tuesday\"* or *\"The professor gave the lecture on Monday\"*), the listener cannot definitively decide which meaning applies.\n\n---\n### **How to resolve ambiguity?**\n- Add a time reference for the lecture (e.g., *\"on Tuesday\"*).\n- Clarify the speaker\u2019s intent (e.g., *\"The professor said on Monday that he would give the lecture\"* vs. *\"The professor gave the lecture on Monday\"*).\n\nWould you like further clarification on either interpretation?",
