  "response": "The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Explanation:**\nPremise 1 states that no reptiles are warm-blooded, meaning all reptiles (including snakes) must be cold-blooded. Premise 2 establishes that all snakes are reptiles. Therefore, by substitution, all snakes are not warm-blooded. The conclusion is valid because it directly follows from the premises without any exceptions or additional assumptions.\n\nAnswer: Valid",
