  "prompt": "Read the passage and answer the question. Your answer should demonstrate understanding of implicit information, not just surface-level facts.\n\nPassage: The museum's newest exhibit was empty at 3 PM on a Tuesday. Marcus, the security guard, wasn't surprised. He'd watched attendance drop every year for the past decade. Kids took selfies in the sculpture garden and left. Adults speed-walked through, checking items off bucket lists. But today, one woman sat alone before the Monet for nearly an hour, no phone in sight, just watching light play across painted water lilies. Marcus found himself standing beside her, seeing the painting differently.\n\nQuestion: What does this passage suggest about how people engage with art?",
  "response": "The passage suggests that people's engagement with art varies significantly. While some may glance at or quickly move through an exhibit, others like the woman described engage deeply and thoughtfully, allowing for a more profound appreciation of the artwork. This highlights diversity in how individuals interact with art\u2014some find it superficial or hurried, while others make intentional efforts to fully immerse themselves in the experience.",
