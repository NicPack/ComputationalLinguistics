  "prompt": "Solve the mathematical problem. Show your work step-by-step and explain your reasoning.\n\nProblem: A store is having a 25% off sale. After the discount, a jacket costs $60. What was the original price?\n\nLet's approach this step by step:",
  "response": "Let's solve this problem step by step to find the original price of the jacket.\n\n### **Problem Statement Recap:**\n- A store offers a **25% discount** on a jacket.\n- After applying the discount, the jacket costs **$60**.\n- We need to find the **original price** before the discount.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Discount**\nA **25% discount** means the customer pays **75%** of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).\n\nMathematically:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Price} = \\text{Original Price} \\times (1 - \\text{Discount Percentage})\n\\]\n\\[\n60 = \\text{Original Price} \\times 0.75\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for the Original Price**\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for the original price:\n\\[\n\\text{Original Price} = \\frac{60}{0.75}\n\\]\n\nNow, perform the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{60}{0.75} = 80\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Answer**\nLet\u2019s check if this makes sense:\n- Original price = **$80**\n- 25% of $80 = \\( 0.25 \\times 80 = 20 \\)\n- Discounted price = \\( 80 - 20 = 60 \\)\n\nThis matches the given final price, so our calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nThe original price of the jacket was **$80**.",
