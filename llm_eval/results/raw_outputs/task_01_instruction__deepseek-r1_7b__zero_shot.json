  "response": "The laptop stand is $35 and effectively keeps my laptop upright during long hours of work at the desk. It's sturdy and secure, which is a significant pro. However, one con is that it lacks padding, making it feel jarring when moving around. Overall, it's worth the purchase, earning it a 4/5 stars rating.",
